This is a website that attempts to push my original [Spotify Playlist Analyzer Python Project](https://github.com/NLeRoy917/spotify-playlist-analyzer) to the web. It lets you choose a playlis and then analyze many of the musical elements like: Tempo, Duration, Modality, Genres, etc. Powered by Flask and React, it simply interfaces the Spotify API to provide you with the most interesting and clean data.

[Link to current production build](https://spottydata.com)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## For development

In the web/ directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Please reach out to me if you'd like access to the necessary development environment variables to contribute!
